        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Nikola Petreski, and I am a Full Stack web developer with
          over five years of experience with UI design. I take great pride in
          the actual process of creating a beautiful and optimized application
          that brings joy to the users who may incorporate it as a part of their
          life. I come from a multidisciplinary background in management,
          policy, and natural sciences. It was there that I realized just how
          interconnected the world of computing is to the rest of the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          My personal favorite technology stack is ReactJS for the front end,
          with MongoDB and NodeJS/Express to fulfill backend needs. Furthermore,
          for solo projects I feel like I am able to get a lot of value through
          just React and FireBase. I am also familiar with using Django and
          Flask to build backends, with some experience building graphical user
          interfaces with Python.

        </button>

        <p>
          Click the button above to check out Zen Planner, a minimalistic take
          on a Todo app that allows you to plan your day and keep track of your
          progress. It is built with ReactJS, and has an interesting take on
          styling. I attempt to utilize a minimalist approach while still
          incorporating some of the more modern design trends like multicolor
          gradients and shadows.

          <h2>Wizard Memory</h2>
        </button>
        <p>
          This is a memory game built with ReactJS. It is a simple game that
          tests your memory. The goal is to click on each image only once. If
          you click on the same image twice, you lose. The game is over when you
          have clicked on all 12 images. The game will keep track of your score
          and will reset when you lose. This particular game has a twist, as it
          has a magical medieval theme.
